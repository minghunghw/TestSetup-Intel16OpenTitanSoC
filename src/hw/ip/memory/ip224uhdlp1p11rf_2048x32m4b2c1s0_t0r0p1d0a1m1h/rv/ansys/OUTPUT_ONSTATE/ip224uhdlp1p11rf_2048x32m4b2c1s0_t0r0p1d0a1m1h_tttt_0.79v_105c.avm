#ck2q_delay: specified clock-to-output pin delay (s) for the associated vdd pin voltages  - use worst case clk-q delay reported in lib
#tr_q: specifies output pin rising transition time (s) for the associated VDD pin voltages - use the worst case reported in lib
#tf_q: specifies output pin falling transition time (s) for the associated VDD pin voltages - use the worst case reported in lib
#tsu: specifies setup (s) for the associated VDD pin voltages - use the worst of all setups - we need to calculate this from lib
#cpd_avm_read: specifies the power dissipation capacitance during read (Farads) for the associated VDD - calculate from Pread_wc/vdd*vdd
#cpd_avm_write: specifies the power dissipation capacitance during write (Farads) for the associated VDD - calculate from Pwrite_wc/vdd*vdd
#cpd_avm_standby_trig: specifies cpd_avm_standby_trig value (Farads) for the associated VDD - need this included in char( clk inactive power), and grab Pstandby/vdd*vdd
##cpd_avm_standby_ntrig: specifies cpd_avm_standby_ntrig value (Farads) for the associated VDD - need this included in char( clk inactive power), and grab Pstandby/vdd*vdd

#c_load: specifies load cap value (Farads) for the associated VDD. value = (# dout pins) * (per pin cload in power CZ). Decided to keep this as NB*21fF
#c_decap: specifies decap (Farads) for the associated VDD. Optional and calculated by AVM flow.
#leakage_i: specifies leakage current (Amps) for the associated VDD - calculate from leakage power/vdd
#Ipeak avm_read (Amps) - Add a probe on vddp for clk power sim and measure max current at read. Characterize this and get the value. Or,  use icct current profile/PWL and get the max value from there.
#Ipeak avm_write (Amps) - Add probe on vddp for clk power sim and measure max current at read. Characterize this and get the value.  Or,  use icct current profile/PWL and get the max value from there.
